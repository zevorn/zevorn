Hello, welcome my blog!

As an experienced software engineer, I bring a robust technical background and diverse practical experience. Proficient in C/C++ (mainly C) and familiar with Shell, Python, and Rust.

Skilled in build scripts (Makefile, CMake, Meson) and with two years of low-level software performance optimization, I have developed a high-performance JIT engine comparable to QEMU/TCG. My expertise extends to LLVM development, focusing on backend JIT optimization and frontend IR applications.

I am well-versed in ARMv8 architecture, adept at ARM assembly (A64/A32/Thumb). With experience in x86 assembly and Intel VTune for performance tuning, I also have a track record optimizing PowerPC, C6K (DSP), and MIPS architectures, particularly in binary dynamic translation.

Deeply knowledgeable about Linux OS and embedded systems, I have debugged mainstream embedded OS, developed an RTOS, and ported mainstream RTOS solutions. A proficient Git user, I have extensive experience in version control and collaborative coding. I have managed toolchain upgrades, including GCC, binutils, and third-party library integrations.

I thrive on challenges, continuously learning, and collaborating. With experience leading R&D teams and coordinating cross-departmentally, I also contribute to open-source communities like QEMU, TechBase, rCore at Tsinghua, and maintain the Gevico Open Source Community.
