Hello, welcome my blog!

As an experienced software engineer, I bring a robust technical background and diverse practical experience. Proficient in C/C++ (mainly C) and familiar with Shell, Python, and Rust.

Skilled in build scripts (Makefile, CMake, Meson) and with two years of low-level software performance optimization, I have developed a high-performance JIT engine comparable to QEMU/TCG. My expertise extends to LLVM development, focusing on backend JIT optimization and frontend IR applications.

I thrive on challenges, continuously learning, and collaborating.
